          - returns the correct length
          - can handle reads and writes of different sizes, and
            returns the same data as was written 
          - reads data from the proper location in the images, and
            doesn't overwrite incorrect locations on write. 
          - continues to read and write correctly after one of the
            disks fails. (call image_fail() on the image blkdev to
            force it to fail) 
          - continues to read and write (correctly returning data
            written before the failure) after the disk is replaced. 
          - reads and writes (returning data written before the first
            failure) after the other disk fails
